# Applying Generative AI in Auditing with Python - WCARS 66
Welcome to the "Applying Generative AI in Auditing with Python" workshop!

In this repository you will find the notebooks that support each use case. You don't need to download the source data files (pdf, xlsx), as those are automatically loaded on the notebook.

On file key.txt you will find an api key that you can use to run the notebooks by yourself during the workshop. You just need to:
- Open one of the workshop's notebooks on Colab
- Open the tab "Secrets" (on the left side)
- Add a new secret with
  - Name: OPENAI_API_KEY
  - Value: the content of the key.txt file
  - Make sure the switch "Notebook access" is turned on

Note: the key will only be available during the workshop. For further testing, you may create an account, setup a payment method and get your own key on https://platform.openai.com
